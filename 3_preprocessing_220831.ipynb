      "\n",
      "Recently we published an article on the attacks against Japanese banks using a new variant of the popular Zeus, one of the most prolific malware of recent history, security experts in fact have detected various versions of the popular malicious code that hit also mobile and social networking platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due its flexibility the malware has been re-engineered several times by cyber criminals that adapted its structure to specific purposes and context, leaving unchanged its core capabilities of stealing banking credentials of victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zeus has been a huge success in the criminal circles especially for the sales model, as malware as service, implemented by its authors on many underground sites, let's remind for example the Citadel Trojan one of the most popular on the crimeware market.\n",
      "Fortunately its author, known as Aquabox, has been banned from a large online forum that sells malware and other services to cyber criminals, but many security firms consider Citadel Trojan still very active threat that continues to infect many machines all over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security experts from McAfee Labs are sure that the agent will remain active for a long time, it also indicate that some groups of hackers are staring to use the malware for other purposes such as the cyber espionage.\n",
      "McAfee Global Threat Intelligence report indicates the \"Poetry Group\" is one of the most active in this sense, the collective compromised 27 Japanese government offices across three distinct campaigns and targeted around 43 government offices in Poland.\n",
      "The group was very aggressive in October 2012 when it conducted more than a half-dozen campaigns infecting victims in Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Netherlands, Estonia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Japan, compromising more than 1,000 victims worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers from McAfee Labs were able to pinpoint the regions \"and identify targets and victims spanning more than a half-dozen campaigns\", the highest infection rate were registered in Denmark, Poland, Spain and Japan.Curiously Japan is one of the most targeted countries by cyber espionage campaign, in many cases we have spoken about cyber attacks malware based that hit industry and government offices of the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The victims located in Poland appears to be all government offices and the exerts discovered that attackers conducted a targeted campaign on specific targets across the country from December 2012 to January 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice the way the hackers used to \"identify\" their works, they in fact added strings of poetry in the malware binary, Ryan Sherstobitoff, a McAfee researcher declared: \"We've found them making political statements against the groups they are targeting,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "McAfee analysts detected more that 300 unique Citadel Trojan samples, each of them included its sequence of poetry strings that aren't automatically generated , the specialists suspect that Poetry Group may be a byproduct of a for-hire data-gathering operation for a private clientele.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fight against malware such as Citadel it is fundamental a layered approach that was able to detect the cyber threats and also any suspect behavior within target networks.\n",
      "In many cases such malware are demonstrated to be able to elude common antivirus systems and their behavioral detection mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately these agents are able to remain silently for a long period infiltrating internal systems and remaining undetected in the target networks for long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The adaptation of the Citadel malware for other uses is a scaring signal due the capabilities of the malicious agent, the Trojan make possible remote control of victims and is able to steal any kind of information, not only banking credentials from victims.\n",
      "Sherstobitoff added: \"If they wanted to penetrate the entire network of a financial institution or some other organization, they could,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Waiting for further updates on the operations of the Poetry Group lets keep update antivirus software and any other application that runs on our systems, because as Sherstobitoff added \"These attacks result from not taking patch management seriously,\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Lazarus Group, the advanced persistent threat (APT) group attributed to the North Korean government, has been observed waging two separate supply chain attack campaigns as a means to gain a foothold into corporate networks and target a wide range of downstream entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest intelligence-gathering operation involved the use of MATA malware framework as well as backdoors dubbed BLINDINGCAN and COPPERHEDGE to attack the defense industry, an IT asset monitoring solution vendor based in Latvia, and a think tank located in South Korea, according to a new Q3 2021 APT Trends report published by Kaspersky.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one instance, the supply-chain attack originated from an infection chain that stemmed from legitimate South Korean security software running a malicious payload, leading to the deployment of the BLINDINGCAN and COPPERHEDGE malware on the think tank's network in June 2021.\n",
      "The other attack on the Latvian company in May is an \"atypical victim\" for Lazarus, the researchers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not clear if Lazarus tampered with the IT vendor's software to distribute the implants or if the group abused the access to the company's network to breach other customers.\n",
      "The Russian cybersecurity firm is tracking the campaign under the DeathNote cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not all.\n",
      "In what appears to be a different cyber-espionage campaign, the adversary has also been spotted leveraging the multi-platform MATA malware framework to perform an array of malicious activities on infected machines.\n",
      "\"The actor delivered a Trojanized version of an application known to be used by their victim of choice, representing a known characteristic of Lazarus,\" the researchers noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to previous findings by Kaspersky, the MATA campaign is capable of striking Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, with the attack infrastructure enabling the adversary to carry out a multi-staged infection chain that culminates in the loading of additional plugins, which allow access to a wealth of information including files stored on the device, extract sensitive database information as well as inject arbitrary DLLs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond Lazarus, a Chinese-speaking APT threat actor, suspected to be HoneyMyte, was found adopting the same tactic, wherein a fingerprint scanner software installer package was modified to install the PlugX backdoor on a distribution server belonging to a government agency in an unnamed country in South Asia.\n",
      "Kaspersky referred to the supply-chain incident as \"SmudgeX.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The development comes as cyber attacks aimed at the IT supply chain have emerged as a top concern in the wake of the 2020 SolarWinds intrusion, highlighting the need to adopt strict account security practices and take preventive measures to protect enterprise environments.\n",

      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, Oracle patched a highly critical Java deserialization remote code execution vulnerability in its WebLogic Server component of Fusion Middleware that could allow attackers to easily gain complete control of a vulnerable server.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a security researcher, who operates through the Twitter handle @pyn3rd and claims to be part of the Alibaba security team, has now found a way using which attackers can bypass the security patch and exploit the WebLogic vulnerability once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "WebLogic Server acts as a middle layer between the front end user interface and the backend database of a multi-tier enterprise application.\n",
      "It provides a complete set of services for all components and handles details of the application behavior automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially discovered in November last year by Liao Xinxi of NSFOCUS security team, the Oracle WebLogic Server flaw (CVE-2018-2628) can be exploited with network access over TCP port 7001.\n",
      "\n",
      "If exploited successfully, the flaw could allow a remote attacker to completely take over a vulnerable Oracle WebLogic Server.\n",
      "The vulnerability affects versions 10.3.6.0, 12.1.3.0, 12.2.1.2 and 12.2.1.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for the original Oracle WebLogic Server vulnerability has already been made public on Github and someone has just bypassed the patch as well, your up-to-date services are again at risk of being hacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although @pyn3rd has only released a short GIF (video) as a proof-of-concept (PoC) instead of releasing full bypass code or any technical details, it would hardly take a few hours or days for skilled hackers to figure out a way to achieve same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, it is unclear when Oracle would release a new security update to address this issue that has re-opened CVE-2018-2628 flaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to be at least one-step safer, it is still advisable to install April patch update released by Oracle, if you haven't yet because attackers have already started scanning the Internet for vulnerable WebLogic servers.\n",
